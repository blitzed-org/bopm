Make
----

    Compilation of BOPM requires GNU Make. No configuration scripts are
neccessary, just 'make' (gmake on BSD systems) to compile the bot.

Configuration
-------------

    Rename bopm.conf.sample to bopm.conf, edit as needed. Most options are
self explanatory and contain a short description.

Execution
---------

    Run bopm from the same directory as bopm.conf. The bot will fork and
connect to the IRC server immediately. Any errors and debug information
can be found in bopm.log.
