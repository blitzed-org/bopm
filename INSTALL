Make
----

    Compilation of BOPM requires GNU Make.  No configuration scripts are
neccessary, just 'make' (gmake on BSD systems) to compile the bot.

Configuration
-------------

    Rename bopm.conf.sample to bopm.conf, edit as needed.  Most options are
self explanatory and contain a short description.

Execution
---------

    Run bopm from the same directory as bopm.conf.  The bot will fork and
connect to the IRC server immediately.  Any errors and debug information can be
found in bopm.log.

    Further debugging can be enabled by using one or more -d switches.  One or
more -d switches will cause the bot to not fork on startup, and it will send
all log messages to stederr (i.e., your terminal) instead of its logfile.  It
will also cause extra debugging information that is not normally of interest to
be sent to stderr.  Two or more -d switches will enable logging of all IRC
traffic received and sent.
