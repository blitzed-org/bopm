Introduction
------------

BOPM (Blitzed Open Proxy Monitor) is an open proxy monitoring bot designed for
Bahamut and Hybrid based ircds.  The bot is designed to monitor an individual 
server (all servers on the network have to run their own bot) with a local o: 
line and monitor connections.  When a client connects to the server, BOPM will 
scan the connection for insecure proxies.  Insecure proxies are determined by 
attempting to connect the proxy back to another host (usually the IRC server in 
question).

BOPM is written ground-up in C language, concept derived from wgmon.  It
improves on wgmon with HTTP support, faster scanning (it can scan clients
simultaneously), better layout (scalability), and dnsbl support.

Compatibility
-------------

Bahamut (tested with 1.4.28)
Hybrid (tested with 2.8/hybrid-5.3p8)
Unreal (tested with 3.1.2 and 3.2)
Xnet (tested with 6.1.3)


BOPM is designed for the Bahamut and Hybrid IRCds.   It would be easily
portable to any other ircd with little modification (to the +c notice code).
However, if an ircd does not send IP's in a connection notice (bahamut sends
[IP]), BOPM will not be effective because the time it takes to resolve a
hostname would be a significant factor to BOPM's efficiency.

If you want to use BOPM but you don't think your ircd supports it then please
contact us.  As long as source is available for your ircd then we can almost
certainly make BOPM work with it.  We have already done this for Unreal and
Xnet ircds.

Any questions regarding compatibility should be sent to the developers. If
feasible we might be able to add compatibility to multiple ircd types to the
project in the future.


Operator Channel Commands
-------------------------

botnick <check> <host>  -- Manually scan host for insecure proxies and output all errors.
botnick stats           -- Output scan stats, uptime and client connection count.


Rehashing the Configuration File
--------------------------------

Everytime BOPM reconnects to the IRC server it rereads its configuration file.
It is then possible to rehash the bot by /kill'ing it.


Support
-------

BOPM now has a mailing list for general discussion and announcements.  CVS
commit emails are also sent there and that is also the place to mail your
patches (unless they are massive, in which case just post a URL).  You can
subscribe to this list from:

  http://lists.blitzed.org/mailman/listinfo/bopm

If you need help in closer to realtime, you can find us in #blitzed on
irc.blitzed.org.
