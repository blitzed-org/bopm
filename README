Introduction
------------

BOPM (Blitzed Open Proxy Monitor) is an open proxy monitoring bot designed for
Bahamut and Hybrid based ircds.  The bot is designed to monitor an individual 
server (all servers on the network have to run their own bot) with a local o: 
line and monitor connections.  When a client connects to the server, BOPM will 
scan the connection for insecure proxies.  Insecure proxies are determined by 
attempting to connect the proxy back to another host (usually the IRC server in 
question).

BOPM is written ground-up in C language, concept derived from wgmon.  It
improves on wgmon with HTTP support, faster scanning (it can scan clients
simultaneously), better layout (scalability), and dnsbl support.

Compatibility
-------------

Bahamut (tested with 1.4.28)
Hybrid (tested with 2.8/hybrid-5.3p8)
Unreal (tested with 3.1.2 and 3.2)
Xnet (tested with 6.1.3)


BOPM is designed for the Bahamut and Hybrid IRCds It would be easily portable
to any other ircd with little modification (to the +c notice code). However,
if an ircd does not send IP's in a connection notice (bahamut sends [IP]),
BOPM will not be effective because the time it takes to resolve a hostname
would be a significant factor to BOPM's efficiency.

Any questions regarding compatibility should be sent to the developers. If
feasible we might be able to add compatibility to multiple ircd types
to the project in the future.


Operator Channel Commands
-------------------------

botnick <check> <host>  -- Manually scan host for insecure proxies and output all errors.
botnick stats           -- Output scan stats, uptime and client connection count.


Rehashing the Configuration File
--------------------------------

Everytime BOPM reconnects to the IRC server it rereads 
its configuration file. It is then possible to rehash
the bot by /kill'ing it.
