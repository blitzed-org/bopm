Introduction
-----------

BOPM (Blitzed Open Proxy Monitor) is an open proxy monitoring
bot designed for Dalnet based ircds. The bot is designed to
monitor an individual server (all servers on the network have
to run their own bot) with a local o line and monitor connections.
When a client connects to the server, BOPM will scan the connection
for insecure proxies. Insecure proxies are determined by attempting
to connect the proxy back to another host (usually the IRC server
in question).


BOPM is written groundup in C language, concept derived from wgmon
wgmon. It improves on wgmon with HTTP support, faster scanning (it can
scan clients simultaneously), better layout (scalability), and 
dnsbl support.


Operator Channel Commands
-------------------------

botnick <check> <host>  -- Manually scan host for insecure proxies and output all errors.
