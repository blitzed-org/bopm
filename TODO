Retain ops with chanserv (grifferz)
Dynamic configuration of protocols/ports (lilo)
IRIX Compatibility (irc.gr)
asynchronous DNS for dnsbl resolution (erik/strtok)
Handling "nick in use" situations:
	- Connect with random nick
	- oper
	- kill user holding nick
	- ID to services / join channels
	- Suggested by Simorgh <simorgh@dataphone.se>
	- Minor flaw to this - user holding nick not on local server. - MrFridge
	- So use Q: lines? - Simorgh
	- Or nickserv GHOST? - grifferz
