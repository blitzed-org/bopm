2002-08-22 22:42  andy

	* src/: negcache.c, negcache.h: src/negcache.[ch]:     
	Implementation of a patricia trie for storing IP addresses and 
	timestamps.  This data structure will allow searches for nodes 
	with only log_2 N bit comparisons where N is the current number of 
	    nodes.  It also only requires as many nodes as there are IP    
	addresses to store.
	
		Each node stores a key (the IP address), a timestamp, the
	bit
		index, and left and right branches.  The bit index is what
	makes
		this different from a radix search tree, it tells us at
	which bit
		this node's key differs from those above it in the trie.
	
		Properties of the trie:
		  1) The bit index always decreases as we follow the tree
	from the head
		     to an external node.
		  2) Each branch of an external node points to the only
	node that can
		     contain keys that match the bit pattern.  All searches
	terminate
		     at external nodes.
		  3) When trying to search for a bit pattern that is not
	present in the
		     tree, you will hit an external node at the place where
	your bit
		     pattern first deviates from all current nodes.  You
	can tell this
		     has happened because the next node's bit index will be
	larger than
		     the current, which would be contrary to point (1).
		  4) Because the bit increments in each node store
	information about
		     where each node's bit pattern differs from all others
	in the tree,
		     extra nodes are not needed - unlike in a radix tree.
		  5) As for a radix tree, a patricia trie will always end
	up the
		     same no matter what order the nodes are inserted.

2002-08-22 21:41  andy

	* src/scan.c: src/scan.c:	scans_active_for_addr() - walk the
	scan list and check if there are     any other scans in progress
	for a given IP address (as specified in     dot quad format).
	
		When a scan fails and negative caching is enabled, check if
	there
		are other scans in progress for the same address.  If not,
	all
		scans have failed and an entry should be added in the
	negcache.
	
		Walking the list after every scan seems inefficient but I
	can't see
		any other way to tell if there are no more scans active. 
	So, at
		the moment this is a good reason for not using negative
	caching.

2002-08-22 21:29  andy

	* src/options.h: src/options.h	NEG_CACHE_REBUILD: how long in
	seconds between rebuilds of the  negcache, if enabled.

2002-08-22 21:28  andy

	* src/main.c: src/main.c:	Periodically rebuild the negcache
	(if enabled) to remove entries	      that are too old.  Note that
	even though this might only happen	   every 12 hours or so,
	old entries are ignored by nc_search()	  anyway.  This is just to
	free up some memory.

2002-08-22 21:17  andy

	* src/irc.c: src/irc.c: 	Upon connection to the IRC server,
	initialise our negative cache	     (if negative caching is
	enabled).
	
		When a user connection is detected, search for their IP in
	our
		negative cache (if negative caching is enabled).  If it is
	present,
		say so in the logfile and don't bother to scan them.
	
		Note that negative caching is only implemented for IPv4 at
	the
		moment -- shouldn't be hard to extend it to IPv6 though.

2002-08-22 21:12  andy

	* src/config.c: src/config.c:	CONF_NEG_CACHE stores the value of
	the NEG_CACHE directive from	     the config.

2002-08-22 21:11  andy

	* src/bopchecker.c: src/bopchecker.c:	Dummy negcache_insert()
	function so that the bopchecker hack	continues to compile.

2002-08-22 21:10  andy

	* src/: Makefile.am, Makefile.in: Makefile.in, src/Makefile.am,
	src/Makefile.in:	New automake entries for negcache.[ch],
	rebuild makefiles.

2002-08-22 21:08  andy

	* bopm.conf.sample: bopm.conf.sample:	Documentation for new
	NEG_CACHE directive which determines how long	  to cache negative
	results for (if at all).  WE DO NOT RECOMMEND THE     USE OF
	NEGATIVE CACHING!

2002-08-15 10:22  andy

	* README: README:	Typo.

2002-08-15 10:16  andy

	* README: README:	Added a requirements section, specifically
	something about transparent  proxies.  This has been mentioned on
	the lists before but should	   probably be in the README since
	we have just discovered a host whose	BOPM K:lined 100% of users
	due to it being behind a transparent web     proxy. (!)

2002-08-15 05:22  andy

	src/dlclist.h, src/extern.h, src/irc.c, src/main.c, src/options.h,
	src/scanwarn.c, src/scanwarn.h: bopm.conf.sample:     Document
	SCAN_WARNING directive.
	
	src/config/h:	Added new config directive type, TYPE_WILDLIST. 
	This will be like a    linked list, but specifically for wildcards
	(which is the only use we   had for lists before now).	They are
	special because they a) need	   wildcards collapsed and b) don't
	allow duplicate wildcards.
	
		Normal linked lists will be of TYPE_LIST.
	
	src/config.c:	Rewrote add_to_list() and general linked list
	implementation as we	  believe it has never worked.
	
		Added CONF_SCAN_WARNING to hold linked list of notices from
	the
		SCAN_WARNING config directive.
	
		New linked list code needs an init_lists() function to
	allocate the
		heads of all linked lists.
	
	src/extern.h:	Added CONF_SCAN_WARNING.
	
	src/irc.c:	Updated CONF_EXCLUDE code to match new linked list
	implementation.
	
		Removed some left over debug code.
	
	src/main.c:	Added a new function, scanwarn_timer(), in the
	alarm loop.  This	 function will get called once a second and
	will empty the notice	     queue (described later).
	
	src/options.h:	Added option for how many notices to send per
	second.
	
	src/dlclist.[ch]:	Implementation of generic doubly-linked
	circular lists.
	
	src/scanwarn.[ch]:	Maintain a queue of pending notices to be
	sent regarding scanning.      A doubly-linked circular list is used
	as a queue, new notices added	  after the head and removed from
	before the head.

2002-08-12 20:28  andy

2002-08-08 22:11  andy

	* src/scan.c: src/scan.c:	addr is a STRING containing the IP

	match.c, match.h: IRC wildcard matching functions from

	this type are put into a linked list.
	
	Added missing config_memfail() prototype.

	will not be scanned.
	
	Makefile.in: Added new objects and dependencies for match.[cho]
	
	irc.c, irc.h: Added do_connect() function to avoid duplication.

	to remember to change this then.
	
	config.c, dnsbl.c, irc.c, log.c, main.c, opercmd.c, scan.c:    
	Take account of AC_HEADER_STDC check.

	minor changes.	Adds a -c command line argument which tells bopm to
	use a different name for log, pid and config files.  i.e. ./bopm -c
	myserver will use myserver.conf, myserver.log, myserver.pid.
	
	The patch also makes bopm set umode -h on itself after opering, in
	order to prevent the bot appearing in /stats p output (shows opers
	available to help).
	
	bopchecker now takes the -c option also, in the same way as bopm.

	* Makefile, irc.c, misc.c, misc.h, opercmd.c, opercmd.h, stats.c,
	stats.h: Support for oper-only commands.
	
	We keep a list of command structures, each oper command is placed
	into the first free structure and then a /userhost is issued.
	
	When the reply from userhost is received and the user verified as
	an oper then the command can be executed, otherwise it should be
	ignored.  Then the command structure may be cleared and any dynamic
	memory freed.
	
	We may receive userhost replies with no data, indicating that the
	nick left the network before we could check them.  Since we can't
	tell who it is, we need to periodically (in this case, every 2
	minutes) go through our command list and remove any commands that
	have not been executed in that period.
	
	dissect_time() also moved to misc.c, now that it is used by more
	than just the stats functions.
	
	Current limitation: oper commands may have only one parameter.

	* .cvsignore, main.c: getopt_long is not portable, so we'll just
	have to do with only -d for now.
	
	On the plus side, extra -d = higher debug level in case that is
	needed in future (OPT_DEBUG = debug level or 0 for no debug)

2002-01-15 16:04  andy

	* Makefile, extern.h, log.c, main.c: Added command line option -d
