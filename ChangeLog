	* bopchecker.c, bopchecker.h, config.c:

	bopchecker.c:
		Some reorganisation.
	
		"req" field of config hash is now zero'd for all but the parameters
		we need for bopchecker to operate.
	
		Used a sleep(1) to reduce CPU usage.
	
	bopchecker.h:
		Exit values have changed again!  0 and 1 are already in use within
		bopm, so now 15-255 are reserved for bopchecker.
	
		HTTP    =  16
		WinGate =  32
		SOCKS4  =  64
		SOCKS5  = 128
	
	config.c:
		Terminated the config hash with a zero'd entry so that it is easy
		to tell where it ends.

	* bopchecker.c, bopchecker.h:

	bopchecker.h:
		Added bitmasks for the types of proxy.  HTTP is 1, Wingate 2,
		SOCKS4 is 4 and SOCKS5 8.
	
	bopchecker.c:
		Now returns a bitmask of the types of proxies found back to the
		shell. THIS MEANS THAT VALUES > 1 MEAN A PROXY WAS FOUND AND 0
		MEANS NO PROXY WAS FOUND, THIS IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE TO PRIOR
		VERSIONS OF THIS PROGRAM!

	* INSTALL, README, bopchecker.c, extern.h, irc.c, main.c,
	options.h:

	Merged patch from Sotiris Tsimbonis <stsimb@irc.gr> with minor changes.
	Adds a -c command line argument which tells bopm to use a different name
	for log, pid and config files.  i.e. ./bopm -c myserver will use
	myserver.conf, myserver.log, myserver.pid.
	
	The patch also makes bopm set umode -h on itself after opering, in order
	to prevent the bot appearing in /stats p output (shows opers available to
	help).
	
	bopchecker now takes the -c option also, in the same way as bopm.
